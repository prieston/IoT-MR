# Project Abstract

As Mixed Reality applications are penetrating peopleâ€™s daily activities, strong
synergies with Geospatial technologies and the Internet of Things are revealed. The
first is due to the significance of the spatial reference of all involved actors of a Mixed
Reality environment: the end-user, the real and the virtual objects. The second is due
to the ever-increasing participation of sensors controlling devices and machines
always and everywhere. This project attempts to highlight these synergies and propose
a case proving that they crucially empower a Mixed Reality experience.

# Use case

This application proposal demonstrates the scenario of altering a state of the real world by interacting with virtual objects. In our case, the user can select a virtual light switch and turn or or off the light of a philips hue smart light bulb.
